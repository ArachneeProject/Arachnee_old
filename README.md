Arachnee
========
## What is this thing?
Did you notice that the kid in Home Alone (1990), played by Macaulay Culkin, was the brother of Kieran Culkin, the guy who plays Wallace in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) ? I'm sure you have once experienced this feeling of discovering a connection between two movies or actors that seemed to be totally unlinkable.

Because of that, I want to create Arachnee, a 3D database showing all connections between its entries. The idea is to show a movie and every person linked to this movie. Then, if you move to someone, you should see every movie he/she is connected to. Also, if you select  two entries, Arachnee would show the shortest path between them (if it exists). This is what I want Arachnee to provide.

## What is used to develop this?
- I'm using SQLite for the database. I builded it with SqliteBrowser, and it has only 4 entries right now (filling the database will be done later...). 
- Unity3D allows me to create the 3D visualization of the whole thing.
- Arachnee is written in C# with Visual Studio, because, well, I like this language (and Unity doesn't really accept other languages anyway). VS is a very powerful IDE, so I use it to work with efficiency.

## It seems cool. How advanced is Arachnee so far?
Take a look in the Screenshots folder: you'll be able to see the progression of the project (all files are named by date).

It's a personnal project that I'm working on, not on full-time, so it's progressing at its own speed. But I hope you'll enjoy it when the first version will be available :)


Thank you for reading !

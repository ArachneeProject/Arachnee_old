Arachnee
========
## What is Arachnee?
I'm sure you have once experienced the feeling of discovering a connection between two movies or actors that seemed to be totally unrelated. Because of that, I created Arachnee, an interactive 3D database showing all connections between its entries. The idea is to show a movie and every person linked to this movie. Then, if you move to someone, you should see every movie he/she is connected to.

## How advanced is Arachnee so far?
First, Arachnee provide a search engine where you can write the title of a movie to see its connections.

The resulting graph is interactive: you can unfold or fold up an entry, the graph will reorganize itself in a pleasant way.

But thatâ€™s not all: if you have a folder containing some movies on your computer, Arachnee can also process them to build a film library, sorting them by title or by release date as you want.

By clicking on a movie you can have more details about it, and even see its graph if you want, or open the corresponding folder on you computer.

## What is used to develop Arachnee?
Arachnee is written in C# and use Unity3D for all the 3D visualisation. Arachnee also connect to TheMovieDatabase.org  to build a local SQLite database.

## Is it really working?
Of course! Arachnee is a personnal project I started in 2014. A lot of changes were made since but now Arachnee is close to what I wanted it to be in the begining. You can take a look in the Screenshots folder to see the different versions, all files are named by date. 

Thank you for reading!

## What is this thing?
Did you notice that the kid in Home Alone (1990), played by Macaulay Culkin, was the brother of Kieran Culkin, the guy who plays Wallace in Scott Pilgrim vs. the World (2010) ? I'm sure you have once experienced this feeling of discovering a connection between two movies or actors that seemed to be totally unlinkable.

Because of that, I wanted to create Arachnee, a 3D database showing all connections between its entries. The idea is to show a movie and every person linked to this movie. Then, if you move to someone, you should see every movie he/she is connected to.

## What is used to develop this?
- I use the database provided by TheMovieDatabase.org to build a local SQLite database on my computer.
- Unity3D allows me to create the 3D visualization of the whole thing.
- It's written in C# (with Visual Studio).

## How advanced is it so far?
Right now, you can type the title of a movie, then it retrieves the director and all actors linked to this movie.

It's a personnal project that I started in 2014. I worked on it from time to time so lots of changes were done during the process. You can take a look in the Screenshots folder to see the different versions of the project (all files are named by date). Now I don't really work on it anymore, but I leart a lot by doing it :)

Thank you for reading !
